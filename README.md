# Social-Animal-Models
This repository hosts supplementary files for Martin and Jaeggi (under review), *Social animal models for quantifying 
plasticity, assortment, and selection on interacting phenotypes*. Currently, these files include an electronic guidebook ["Estimating Social Animal Models (SAMs) in Stan"](https://jordan-scott-martin.github.io/Social-Animal-Models/) and two R files for replicating our phenotypic (`aggression SAM sim_phenotypeR2.R`) and quantitative genetic (`aggression SAM sim_R2.R`) simulations, with accompanying Stan files for phenotypic (`SAM aggression phenotypic model_R2.stan`) and quantitative genetic (`SAM aggression QG model_R2.stan`) SAMs that are used in the R code. 

Please contact jordan.martin@uzh.ch if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.
